This is a portfolio website created for me, Thomas Nguyen, to show off my projects aswell as give an overview on my education/experience.

It solves the need for anyone interested in me to find out more about me.

I learned a lot about html, css and js. I think creating a frontend project was a lot of fun for me and I learned a lot about using emailjs.
